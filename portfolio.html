        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a hardworking, competent, and detail-oriented person.
            I am a Diploma holder of the course Business Process and Systems Engineering.
            Although I have limited work experience, what I have learnt in my Diploma course has taught me all the necessary skills I need to work in many companies.
